# CAD Files

CAD files associated with the experimental setup are provided here, which were designed using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).

### Z bracket
The piece used to hold the glass slide that acted as the effective pool base. *zBracket.FCStd* contains the full design, whilst the part was printed from *zBracket.stl*.

### Infinity pool
*infinityPool.FCStd* and *infinityPool.stl* contain the designs of the infinity pool. These were used to generate images of the experimental setup (we cut the actual panels with a band saw from [clear polystyrene](https://www.diy.com/departments/styrene-clear-polystyrene-flat-glazing-sheet-l-1-2m-w-0-6m-t-2mm/35393_BQ.prd)).

### Infinity pool setup
*infinityPoolSetup.FCStd* contains the pool, Z bracket, glass slide (effective pool base), and mounting hardware in the correct relative positions. Associated CAD files for the [confocal sensor](https://www.micro-epsilon.co.uk/displacement-position-sensors/confocal-sensor/confocal-chromatic-sensors/confocalDT_2405/) and [vertical translation stage](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=MVS05) can be downloaded elsewhere.
