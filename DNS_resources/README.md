# Shallow pool impact
## Direct numerical simulation summary
Direct numerical simulation code infrastructure for high-speed drop impact onto liquid pools of varying heights, supporting collaborative work with the [Oxford Fluids Laboratory](https://github.com/OxfordFluidsLab).  

## Installation
* The code relies on [Basilisk](<http://basilisk.fr/>) to model the Navier-Stokes equations. See the [installation page](<http://basilisk.fr/src/INSTALL>) for instructions. 
* Full visualisation capabilities have been used in order to generate animations. These may be switched off depending on the local architecture.
